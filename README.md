# Yu-Gi-Oh! Power of Chaos - HD Mod (768p)

A bit unfinished, but working HD mod for Yu-Gi-Oh! Power of Chaos. Feel free to edit it and commit here.

How to run:

* Download data.7z and voice.7z from this repository
	*Mod is in 7z archives, because git breaks something in files, and the game will crash when cloned
* Extract it into the game folder that you want to mod.
* There should be now a data and voice folder that is next to the executable ("joey_pc.exe").
* Download the [Yu-Gi-Oh Mod Tools](https://derplayer.neocities.org/repo/yugioh/index.html)
	* Important: For now only the "clean" no-cd executeable version is supported
	* If the mod dosen't load replace the executeable with a clean "No-CD/Fixed EXE" one.
* Extract & Start the Yu-Gi-Oh Mod Tools
* Open "Advanced Settings"
* File -> Open Patch Template
* Open the "1280x768.joey2"
* Press the Patch Button
* Search your "joey_pc.exe"
* Finished! You can now start the game over the Launcher
